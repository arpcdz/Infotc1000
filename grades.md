# Academics
I have had a great college career and this shows through my academic performance.
I have a 3.85 GPA and am a student in the Honors College. I love my classes this semester and have been very blessed throughout the whole process!

Here is a calculus assignment I recently completed! [Look!](https://github.com/arpcdz/Infotc1000/blob/main/Riemann%20Sums%20WS.pdf) It takes my computer a couple of times to load, but it works!

Thank you for reading!
